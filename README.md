# Predictive-maintenance
- I have presented the concept of **predictive maintenance** and demonstrated how organizations can use this approach to improve their maintenance cycles.
- I trained a classification model using the **XGBoost algorithm** and sensor data from the machine.
- By implementing such a predictive maintenance approach, organizations can improve their operational efficiency and ensure the smooth running of their machinery.
- I have used sensor data and machine learning to predict failures in milling machines. 
- Milling machines have many moving parts that can suffer from wear and tear over time, leading to failures. 
- Additionally, improper maintenance can cause issues with machine operation and lead to costly damage. Efficient maintenance can be challenging due to the varying loads that milling machines are subjected to. 
- However, by implementing a predictive maintenance solution with Python, we can proactively identify and address issues to prevent costly downtime and ensure the smooth operation of our milling machines.
